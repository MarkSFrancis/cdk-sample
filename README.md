# CDK Sample

This project is for me as I learn and explore how to build infrastructure using CDK, parsing its documentation, and understanding its workflow.

If you're looking for good CDK samples for **you** to learn from, I'd suggest that you check out [these samples from AWS](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples)

## Useful commands

 * `yarn test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `yarn cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `yarn cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `yarn cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
